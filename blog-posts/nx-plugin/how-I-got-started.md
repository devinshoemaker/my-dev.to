When Nx version 8 was released, there was a [blog post](https://blog.nrwl.io/nxs-new-look-in-v8-25d7325260d) that stated that the Nx architecture was going towards a more "pluggable package structure". As soon as I read this post, I began pondering the posibilities of third-party Nx plugins.

It wasn't until February of 2020 that I started looking into created my own custom Nx plugin, which was shortly before the official announcement of the Nx community plugin initiative.
