# Outline

- Introduction
- Background and Motivation
  - I have been a fan of both Ionic and Nx for a while now, so once both of these projects added React support, they seemed like a natural pair. However, when I attempted to convert an Nx React application, I quickly ran into issues. With the help of the community and the Nrwl team, we are now able to develop Ionic React applications in an Nx workspace. Over the last few weeks, I have been developing an Nx plugin to automate the generation of an Ionic React application, and I'm excited to finally share it.
